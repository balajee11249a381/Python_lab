Program:  
number = int(input("Enter the integer = "))  
factorial = 1  
if number <0 :  
print("Factorial does not exist")  
elif number == 0:  
print("Factorial of 0 is 1")  
else:  
for i in range(1,number+1):  
factorial = factorial*i  
print(f"factorial of {number} = {factorial}")  

OUTPUT:
Enter the integer = 25  
factorial of 25 = 15511210043330985984000000
