import openpyxl 
from openpyxl import Workbook

# Step 1: Load the workbook and select the sheet to read 
read_wb = openpyxl.load_workbook("input_data.xlsx") 
read_sheet = read_wb.active 

# Step 2: Create a new workbook for writing 
write_wb = Workbook() 
write_sheet = write_wb.active 

# Step 3: Read data from read_sheet and write to write_sheet 
for i in range(1, read_sheet.max_row + 1): 
for j in range(1, read_sheet.max_column + 1): 

# Read from input sheet 
cell_value = read_sheet.cell(row=i, column=j).value 

# Write to output sheet 
write_sheet.cell(row=i, column=j).value = cell_value 

# Step 4: Save the new workbook 
write_wb.save("output_data.xlsx")

OUTPUT: 
Assume your input_data.xlsx file contains: 
Name 
John 
Age

After execution, a new file output_data.xlsx is created with the same data.
