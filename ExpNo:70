temperatures = [32, 34, 29, 31, 28, 33, 35, 36, 30, 28, 31, 32, 34, 35, 29, 30]

avg_temp = sum(temperatures) / len(temperatures)
days_above_avg = sum(1 for t in temperatures if t > avg_temp)
temp_difference = max(temperatures) - min(temperatures)

print("Average Temperature =", avg_temp)
print("Days Above Average =", days_above_avg)
print("Temp Difference =", temp_difference)

OUTPUT:
Average Temperature = 31.5
Days Above Average = 8
Temp Difference = 8
