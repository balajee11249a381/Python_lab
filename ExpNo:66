Total budget = 10000
Marketing Ratio = 3
Development Ratio = 5
Operations Ratio = 2

Total Ratio = 3 + 5 + 2 = 10

Calculation:

Marketing = (3/10) × 10000 = 3000
Development = (5/10) × 10000 = 5000
Operations = (2/10) × 10000 = 2000

Expected Output:

Marketing budget: 3000.00
Development budget: 5000.00
